        <p>Music is a way to exress your feelings or emotions.It can be therapeutic. Human beings have been entertaining themselves through music since centuries. They realised that this calms the mind and helps in releaving stress, axiety, anger etc. It helps in improveing the mood and connect with nature. It is a certified therapy to address physical, emotional, cogitive and social needs of individuals. It reduces the heart rate which lowers the blood preasure and cotisol in our body. At last, I would like to say- "Sometimes Music can be the only Medicine the heart and the soul need as it has the healing power by which it takes people ut of themselves for a few hours."</p>
